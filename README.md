# Matlab
The FSolver function calls one of the three other functions before attempting to solve them via numerical analysis.

The other functions model how a 6 axis passive compliance device would behave when subjected to forces (N) in X,Y and Z as well as one moment about either X,Y or Z. 

Files can be run using MatLab software.
