# Matlab

As part of my dissertation I had to model a 6-axis passive compliance device (which would attach to the end of a robot arm) under different loads (forces (N) and moments (Nmm)). The function of the MATLAB scripts is detailed below.


The FSolver function calls one of the three other functions before attempting to solve them via numerical analysis.

The other functions model how a 6 axis passive compliance device would behave when subjected to forces (N) in X,Y and Z as well as one moment about either X,Y or Z. 

Files can be run using MatLab software.
